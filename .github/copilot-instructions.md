# Copilot Instructions for Ansible_tutorial

## Project Overview
This repository contains Ansible playbooks, roles, and configuration files for automating server setup, focusing on CentOS and Debian systems. The main goal is to provision, configure, and manage servers (including desktop environments like XFCE) using reusable Ansible roles and tasks.

## Key Structure
- `ansible.cfg`, `inventory`, `hosts.ini`: Ansible configuration and inventory files.
- `playbooks/`: Main playbooks for different automation scenarios.
- `playbooks/roles/`: Contains reusable roles (e.g., `base`, `centos_server`, `debian_server`, `xfce`).
- Each role has standard subfolders: `tasks/`, `handlers/`, `files/`, `templates/`, and sometimes `vars/`.

## Patterns & Conventions
- **Role Structure:** Follows Ansible best practices for role layout. Each role's `tasks/main.yml` is the entry point.
- **OS-Specific Logic:** Uses `when` clauses to target CentOS or Debian (see `xfce/tasks/configuration.yml`).
- **File/Template Management:** Uses `copy` and `template` modules to manage configuration files. Templates are Jinja2 (`.j2`).
- **Idempotency:** Tasks are written to be idempotent (safe to re-run).
- **Tagging:** Tasks are tagged (e.g., `tags: configuration`) for selective execution.
- **Handlers:** Used for service restarts (e.g., `notify: restart gdm`).

## Developer Workflows
- **Run a playbook:**
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/site.yml
  ```
  Or for automation_project:
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini playbook/xfce-intall.yml
  ```
- **Test changes:** Use a local VM or container matching the target OS. No automated test suite is present.
- **Debugging:** Use `-vvv` for verbose output. Use `--tags` to run specific parts.

## Project-Specific Notes
- **Custom Desktop Environment Setup:** The `xfce` role configures XFCE as the default desktop, disables other sessions, and manages GDM settings.
- **Sensitive Files:** Some files (e.g., `sudoer_simon`, `standard`) are copied directly to system locations—ensure correct permissions.
- **Absolute Paths:** Some tasks use absolute paths for `src`/`dest`—update if directory structure changes.
- **Manual Steps:** Some configuration (e.g., user templates) may require manual verification after playbook runs.

## Examples
- See `playbooks/roles/xfce/tasks/configuration.yml` for advanced session management and desktop environment enforcement.
- See `base/` and `centos_server/` roles for basic system setup patterns.
